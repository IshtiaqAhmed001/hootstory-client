### Project Details

To make the frontend(client side) I have used React,which is a JavaScript Library. I also implemented react router here so the pages of the site loads faster than the regular websites.Then firebase authentication system and private route and JWt token for the security.
For styling I have used a combination of vanilla css and Material-Ui.

For backend (server side) used node and express as a framework.
And lastly for storing data we used mongodb which is a nosql database.
